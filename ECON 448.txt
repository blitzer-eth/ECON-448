The Demographic Transition

Theory explaining/predicting changes in population growth due to economic growth
(population) low growth -> high growth -> low growth
             ------------> economic growth ------->

In general, economic growth is going to drive a decline in death rates. Then, population growth happens. Then birth rates decline. Then the population growth decline.

Stage 1: subsistence period
- income low
- birth rate is high
- death rate is high

Why?
- high infant mortality -> more births
- culture of large families
- no/little contraceptive access

Why high death rate?
- less/no medicine (lots of infectious diseases)
- poor nutrition
- harsh  living conditions

Stage 2: 
- population grows rapidly
- Economic growth drives reduction in death rates -> a lot from reduced infant mortality
- birth rate doesn't fall (yet) *crude birth rate

Why? (micro inertia)
- have more income, so don't need to cut back
- have kids to sustain to care for older population
- risk aversion
- culture

Population momentum (macro inertia)
- population is young
- Childbearing adults out number older people
- births/person high

Stage 3:
- continued economic growth
- birth rates fall
- death rates low
- population growth slows

Individual fertility drops Why?
- changing culture
- increased female labor force participation
- increased education for girls
- more contraceptives
-> Finally, population momentum dissipates

Stage 4:
- more economic growth
- birth rates continue to fall
- death rates fall a little
- population growth falls to zero or negative
-> stationary or aging population

Theories about the effect of population growth on economic growth
1. negative impacts: pessimists include Malthus, Ehrlich
   Malthus - population grows as incomes increase 
- income/person falls if income doesn't keep up
- observed that food supply ("income") doesn't keep up with population
- as income/person falls, death rates increase and/or people have fewer kids
- vicious cycle of "Malthusian Trap"
- neo-Malthusian: limits on clean water, air, etc "spaceship earth"

2. positive impacts: optimists believe that population growth drives economic growth, usually through innovation
2 types
A. demand-driven growth (Esther Boserup ~ 1960s/70s)
- growing population increase demand and incentives to innovate and produce more stuff -> mostly about agriculture technology
B. supply-driven growth ( Michael Kremer ~1990s)
population growth -> greater supply of innovative -> more economic growth

3. Neutral: neutralists (ex: David Bloom ~ 2000s)
- believe that policy accounts for the observed correlation between population and economic growth




Midterm 2 covers first 2 modules (not marriage)

Module 1 Background:
1. Definitions - fertility (ex crude birth rate, age specific fertility rates, total fertility rate), mortality (CMR, ASMR, Life expectancy)
2. population pyramids
3. demographic transition
4. economic growth as a function of population growth
5. poverty - definitions and measures (multidimensional poverty, head count, income gap ratio, etc.)
6. poverty trap + inequality no ge calculation on lorenz curve

1 calculate 1 solve maximize utility function 1 explain something

Module 1+2 (data analysis):
1. Standard linear regression - interpreting coefficients on continuous and dummy variables (not gonna ask what p-value, standard error means)
2. Sources of bias in coefficient estimates (reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error)
3. Program evaluation and bias (omitted variables/ selection bias)
4. solutions (randomized control trials, natural experiment, instrumental variables)
Maximization Problems on Fertility 

Module 2 (fertility):
1. demand for children as old-age support (Ray's model or p-q model)
   - have kids until have sufficient old age security
     ex: q=95% -> willing to accept 5% risk of not receiving care
         p=50% -> chance that any one child can care for parents
         => solve for n as a function of p+q
2. demand for kids to maximize u(n,z) n=# of kids, z = all other goals (Becker's model) subject to budget constraint
3. previous problem, but incorporate time costs of children -> new constraint T=L+kn <- T fixed, choose L+n
4. Problem in #2, but introduce child quality as a substitute for quantity 
   I = p_z +p_q * q * n + p_n *n (p_q * q * n important)
   q - quality investment (health/education)
5. sex ratios, son preferences, Rosenblum paper -> think about the bias problem & Rosenblum's solution
6. Family planning programs, demand for contraceptives
   Does family planning/contraceptive access cause fertility to fall?
   Miller -> looks at Profamilia & fertility decline (think about bias & Miller's solution)
7. (Still Miller, also Geldmokats): does fertility reduction cause women's well-being to improve?
   - finds later marriages and later first birth, more education
=> All together -> reasons why n falls with economic growth 


Midterm 2:
Module: marriage
Economics reasons
- risk-sharing
- coordination of credit
- sharing of non-rivalrous goods
- Joint production & consumption
ex: z=xt where x=wh h+t=1
- easy to solve for single person
- use foc (substitution/lagrange)
- get: h=t=1/2 x^*=w

for a couple: Z_ab = (X_a + X_b)(t_a +t_b)
2 cases:
1. W_a 
2. W_a> W_b => Z_ab^* = W_a

Joint gains:

Individual gains:

Marriage Payments
- what is Dowrg, what types of societies
- what is birthprice, what types of societies
- gains from marriage + Dowrg/Birthprice)
- explanations for Dowrg growth including marriage squeeze (2nd stage demographic transition (DT)), economic growth &groom heterogeneity 

Intra-household Decision Making
two models
1. unitary (dictator) model: family pools income & chooses allocation to fulfill one set of preferences
2. Cooperative Bargaining Model
- Two sets of preferences
- allocation reflects preferences & bargaining power
- decision made through negotiation
u_mf = [u_m(c_m)-T_m]*[u_f(c_f)-T_f]

Module: Parental Investments
Mortality - historically decline & causes -> "mortality transition"
- mortality in low-income country (LMIC) today 
- mortality / health
- socioeconomic status gradient

Child Health Production Function
- inputs & outputs?
- role of parent characteristics
 - mom's education -> bias in measuring causal impacts
 - sex preferences
- role of women's employment & bargaining power
 - evidence from China -> price of tea & girls' survival
- longer term consequences
 - adult health & initial health endowment
 - "critical period" -> pre-birth~2years
- evidence from Indonesia
 -> large effects of childhood income on women's adult outcomes
 -> critical period: 0~2 years

Conditional Cash Transfers
- Mexico's Progresa program increased income & schooling
- had health benefits for kids
- also life-long improvements in education & income
